## Quest 1 : Number Representation        
## Rank : F
Computers are designed to use **binary digits** to represent numbers and other information. The computer memory is organized into strings of bits called words of same length. Decimal numbers are first converted into their binary equivalents and then are represented in either integer or floating point form.

**Hexadecimal notation** is also used when working with computers.  The represen-tation uses base 16 rather than base 2. The logic is the same. We need 16 ‘digits’,so we use 0, 1, 2, ..., 9, A, B, C, D, E, F. The letters A, B, C, D, E, and F representthe values 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 respectively
